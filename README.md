## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivmona/Model-selection-and-evaluation.git
   cd Model-selection-and-evaluation
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: If **`requirements.txt`** is not present, you can install packages manually as needed.*

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**:

   - Place your dataset in the `attached_assets/` directory.
   - Ensure the dataset is in CSV format and properly formatted.

2. **Execute the Main Script**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will initiate the data processing, model training, evaluation, and visualization steps.

## 🧩 Key Components

### 1. Data Processing (`data_processor.py`)

- Loads and preprocesses the dataset.
- Handles missing values, encoding, and feature scaling.

### 2. Model Management (`model_manager.py`)

- Defines and trains multiple machine learning models.
- Supports model comparison and selection.

### 3. Evaluation (`evaluation.py`)

- Calculates performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
- Supports cross-validation and other evaluation techniques.

### 4. Visualization (`visualization.py`)

- Generates plots such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance charts.
- Helps in interpreting model performance visually.

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

The project evaluates models using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Correctness of positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Ability to find all positive instances.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.

These metrics provide a comprehensive view of model performance, especially in imbalanced datasets.
