Core Features and Execution Workflows
1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
Purpose: Allow users to upload datasets and perform necessary preprocessing steps.​

Workflow:

Data Upload: Enable users to upload datasets in formats like CSV or Excel.​

Data Validation: Check for missing values, data types, and inconsistencies.​

Preprocessing Options: Provide options for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.​

Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation.​

scikit-learn for preprocessing utilities like SimpleImputer, StandardScaler, and OneHotEncoder.​

SOLID Principles:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Create separate classes/modules for data loading, validation, and preprocessing.​

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Design preprocessing modules to be extendable for new preprocessing techniques without modifying existing code.​

2. Model Selection Interface
Purpose: Provide an interface for users to select and configure machine learning models.​

Workflow:

Model Catalog: Display a list of available models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM).​

Hyperparameter Configuration: Allow users to set hyperparameters for the selected model.​

Libraries:

scikit-learn for model implementations.​

SOLID Principles:

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Ensure that new models can replace existing ones without altering the application's behavior.​

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Provide specific interfaces for different model types to avoid unnecessary dependencies.​

3. Cross-Validation Mechanism
Purpose: Implement cross-validation techniques to assess model performance.​

Workflow:

Cross-Validation Selection: Allow users to choose cross-validation strategies (e.g., K-Fold, Stratified K-Fold).​

Execution: Use selected strategy to split data and evaluate model performance.​

Libraries:

scikit-learn for cross-validation utilities like cross_val_score.​

SOLID Principles:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Maintain a dedicated module for cross-validation separate from model training.​

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend on abstractions for cross-validation strategies to promote flexibility.​
